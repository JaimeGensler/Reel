# Reel - Tutor Matchmaking

_A (university) tutor matchmaking service created by Jaime Gensler_

## About

_My university had a tutoring system where students who previously completed a class (and who were selected by professors) could be paid to tutor other students currently taking that class. Students could also seek writing assistance from general-purpose Writing Tutors. Students who requested help had to be manually assigned to potential tutors by current tutors. The goal of this app is to solve the numerous issues created by this manual assignment._

#### What issues arise from manual tutor assignment?

-   Tutors must be able to view all students and their classes
-   Tutees

_Built with TypeScript, Postgres, Next.js, Ant Design, and React._

## Check it out!

_Currently, the app can be viewed at \_\_\_. Accounts have been pre-made to log in to - because this is intended to be a demo and would rely on a university database, there is no option for account creation. However, usable accounts with different settings (writing tutors, content tutors, both, and neither) have been created, and username/password combinations for these accounts will be listed below._
